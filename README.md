# CCHS-dataset
# This is from a dataset presentation on my work looking at "Immigration as a Social Determinant of Health: Analyzing the Correlates Between Immigrant Status, Acculturation Processes, and Overall Health Outcomes in Canada"
# These were my research questions:
# What parts of the acculturation process may have significant impacts on immigrant health in relativity to non-immigrants? 
# Are there racial group variations that undergo effects of the acculturation-health relationship to different degrees? 
# Is the Healthy Immigrant Effect (HIE) persistent over time for new immigrants in Canada?
